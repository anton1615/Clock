A minimalist, unobtrusive Pomodoro timer widget for Windows, built with .NET 10 and WPF.
Designed to stay out of your way while keeping you focused.

## Features

*   **Minimalist Widget**: Frameless window that sits quietly on your desktop.
*   **Always Visible**: Smart positioning logic ensures it stays on top of your taskbar but doesn't block your work.
*   **Two-Phase Cycle**: Simple "WORK" and "BREAK" phases with visual progress indicators.
*   **Dynamic Theme Background**: Background color automatically adjusts to a darker version of the current phase color.
*   **Instant Interaction**: Click the progress bar to pause/resume, one-click phase switching via modern icon buttons (⏩).
*   **Visual Feedback**: Progress bar and buttons highlight on hover to indicate interactability.
*   **Hacker-Friendly Config**: Customize colors, fonts, and behavior via `setting.json` or a comprehensive graphical interface.
*   **Modern Settings GUI**: Intuitive color pickers, font family dropdown, and audio file browser.
*   **Run at Startup**: Option to automatically start with Windows.
*   **System Tray Integration**: Hides gracefully to the tray when needed.

## Installation & Setup

1.  Download the latest release (or build from source).
2.  Run `clock.exe`.

### 🎵 Important: Sound Effects Setup

To respect copyright laws, **this repository does not include sound files**. You need to provide your own notification sound.

1.  Find a sound effect you like (e.g., a `.wav` file).
2.  Rename it to `notify.wav` (optional, but recommended default).
3.  Place the file in the `Assets` folder next to the executable.
    *   *Alternatively*, use the **"Browse..." button** in the Settings GUI to select any `.wav` file on your computer.
    *   *Config file*: You can also specify a custom path in `setting.json`.

## Configuration (`setting.json`)

On the first run, a `setting.json` file will be generated in the application directory. You can edit this file manually or right-click the system tray icon and select "Settings" to open the graphical configuration interface.

The **Settings GUI** now features:
*   **Visual Color Pickers**: Select colors from a palette with live previews.
*   **Font Family Dropdown**: Choose from all installed system fonts.
*   **File Browser**: Easily pick your notification sound file.
*   **Startup Toggle**: One-click to enable or disable "Run at Startup".
